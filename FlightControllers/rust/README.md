## Rust flight controller for MultiSim

This folder contains an example program showing how to write a flight controller for MultiSim using Rust.
This flight controller ignores the game controller (joystick / RC Transmitter) input and uses a PID 
controller to launch the vehicle to an altitude of 10 meters. To run the program, type <b>cargo run</b>, 
then hit the Play button in the UE5 editor.
