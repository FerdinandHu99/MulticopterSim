## Python flight controller for MultiSim

This folder contains an example program showing how to write a flight
controller for MultiSim using Python.  This flight controller ignores the game
controller (joystick / RC Transmitter) input and uses a PID controller to
launch the vehicle to an altitude of 10 meters.  To try the program, run the
<b>launch.py</b> script, then hit the Play button in the UE5 editor.
